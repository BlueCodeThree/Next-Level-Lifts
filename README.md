Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a lift for a 10 storey building.

A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor. Once in the lift, they can choose the floor they'd like to travel to.

Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop, and open its doors."
