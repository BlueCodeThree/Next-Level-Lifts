# Next Level Lifts

A coding challenge involving writing software for an elevator company

by Carlie Hamilton

## The Challenge

"You are in charge of writing software for an elevator (lift) company.

Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a lift for a 10 storey building.

A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor. Once in the lift, they can choose the floor they'd like to travel to.

Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop, and open its doors."

## Tech Stack

React with Typescript - using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Installation

Fork or clone this repository.

`$ cd frontend`

`$ npm install`

This should install all the dependencies.

## How To Use

To run this, you need to be in the `frontend` directory.

`$ cd frontend`

`$ npm start`

This will start the development server. When the typescript compiles, the website will open in your browser.

### Tests

Tests use Jest.

To test,
`$ cd frontend`
`$ npm test`
